# BenchX

BenchX is a Rust-based concurrent benchmarking and load-testing CLI tool that executes arbitrary system commands under configurable stress. It measures latency distributions (min/avg/p50/p90/p95/p99), throughput, and failure rates to help evaluate system behavior under load. Designed with a modular architecture, BenchX offers precise performance insights using multi-threaded execution and high-resolution timers.

# Examples 
cargo run -- --command "curl -s https://api.github.com" --iterations 5
cargo run -- --command "echo hi" --iterations 3
